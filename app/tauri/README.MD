We are just experimenting with the Tauri implementation at the moment.

The plan is to try to make it as modular and modifiable as possible.

If you have any suggestions for best practices feel free to make some comments ore start a discussion.

Though keep in mind some parts may be coded in specific ways just to experiment with features of rust.
The aim is to do it in a way that it can be replaced with simpler/better solutions.
